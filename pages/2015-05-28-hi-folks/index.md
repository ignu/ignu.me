Thanks for everyone who came to my sessions at [MADEXPO](http://twitter.com/madexpo/).

If you came for JavaScript is Real Code, here’s my [previous post](javascript-is-real-code-slides-and-sample) containg slides and code.

If you came for Getting Git, here’re my slides:

[Getting Git](http://f.cl.ly/items/2w3B0V1p3q1n1v1n342y/getting%20git.pdf)

And some links containing topics that I mentioned.

[Random Git Goodness](/random-git-goodness) – some git tricks I mentioned.

[Git Extras](https://github.com/visionmedia/git-extras) - more sane git commands, worth it for git-delete-branch alone.</p>
