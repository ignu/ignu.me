### Glenn Vanderburg [Real Software Engineering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP9AIUT9nos)

tl;dr: (Spoiler) Software Engineering as a concept is a joke unless you're practicing Agile disciplines.

(Only software talk I've seen get a standing ovation)

### Uncle Bob Martin: [The Renaissance of Craftmanship](http://archive.oredev.org/topmenu/video/keynotebobmartin.4.5a2d30d411ee6ffd28880002007.html)

tl;dr: Be less terrible.

Jim Weirich: The Grand Unified Theory of Software Design

tl;dr: Contranascence is a word. Also, you have not begun to fathom the ways in which our code is coupled.

J.B. Rainsberger: Integration Tests are a Scam

tl;dr: Integration Tests yield shitty ROI because of Math.

Mary Poppendieck: Using Lean for Competitive Advantage

tl;dr: Mary Poppendieck is the best ever

Dan North: Simplicty, The Way of the unusual Architect

Uncle Bob Martin: Twenty-Five Zeros

tl;dr: Your modern language isn't much better than Fortran
